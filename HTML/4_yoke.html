    <h2>Chanel Miller — Reclaiming Identity and Finding Community After Trauma</h2>
    <img src="img_yoke/story3.jpg" alt="Reclaiming My Identity" style="width:100%; max-width:600px; border-radius:15px; margin-bottom:20px;">
    <section id="chanel-miller">
  <h3>Who She Is</h3>
  <p>
    Chanel Miller is a writer, artist, and advocate who became known internationally after publicly sharing her story as a survivor of sexual assault. Her memoir <em>Know My Name</em> chronicles her healing journey and her process of reclaiming her identity after being known only as “Emily Doe” during her assailant’s criminal trial.
  </p>

  <h3>Her Personal Story</h3>
  <p>
    After being sexually assaulted while she was a college student, Miller spent years navigating trauma, stigma, and the criminal justice system. Rather than letting the abuse define her life in silence, she chose to reclaim her voice by telling her story on her terms. Her decision to publish <em>Know My Name</em> was an act of claiming back her identity — rejecting the anonymity imposed on her by the legal process, and standing fully in her truth.
  </p>

  <h3>Rebuilding with Support and Authenticity</h3>
  <p>
    Through writing, speaking out publicly, and engaging with survivor communities, Miller found inclusive spaces where her experiences were validated and supported. By connecting with others who understood her journey, she was able to transform her pain into purpose — helping others feel less alone and encouraging society to take survivors’ voices seriously.
  </p>

  <h3>Advocacy, Growth & Impact</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Her memoir <em>Know My Name</em> became a best‑selling book and received critical acclaim, including major literary awards.</li>
    <li>Miller has used her platform to speak about trauma, healing, justice, and the importance of centering survivors’ voices in legal reforms and cultural conversations.</li>
    <li>Her public presence has helped shape how communities think about consent, respect, and the dignity of sexual assault survivors — inspiring others to reclaim their own identities and narratives.</li>
